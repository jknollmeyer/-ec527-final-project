added two library files that we will be editing
dijkstra_speedup.cpp - we dont need to edit at the moment, just included because that is where we need to include our BFS_speedup.cpp code from
BFS_speedup.cpp - this is the code that we will be editing to parallelization. Specifically the for loop in the breadth_first_visit() function.
TestExample.cpp - this is the code that creates an example of the graph and runs the algorithm on it. Eventually need to expland this to include multiple large (100mil nodes) graphs
